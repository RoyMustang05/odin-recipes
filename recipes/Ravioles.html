    <p>Ravioli is considered a dumpling, with filling sealed between two layers of thin pasta. Though it takes many shapes, including circular or semi-circular forms, the traditional form of ravioli is a square. In Italian cuisine, vegetarian ravioli is served on Fridays! lets review this recipe then!</p>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>5 to 5-1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>6 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>Your choice in between marinara, pesto or Alfredo sauce, (with strong ingredients recommended)</li>
    <li>Cheese of your choice!</li>
    <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
</ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Place 5 cups flour in a large bowl. Make a well in the center. Beat the eggs, water and oil; pour into well. Stir together, forming a ball. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 4-6 minutes, adding remaining flour if necessary to keep dough from sticking. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven, combine sauce ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine filling ingredients. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
    <li>Divide pasta dough into fourths; roll 1 portion to 1/16-in. thickness. (Keep pasta covered until ready to use.) Working quickly, place rounded teaspoons of filling 1 in. apart over half of pasta sheet. Fold sheet over; press down to seal. Cut into squares with a pastry wheel. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.</li>
    <li>Bring a soup kettle of salted water to a boil. Add ravioli. Reduce heat to a gentle simmer; cook until ravioli float to the top and are tender, 1-2 minutes. Drain. Spoon sauce over ravioli.</li>
    <li>Serve in a bowl-like plate the sauce and the ravioli (you can choice a flat place too)</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
