    <p>Brownies are chocolaty baked products made in square or rectangle shapes. They are commonly consumed around the world and are made with flour, fat (oil or butter), sugar, eggs and chocolate (molten or cocoa powder). Nuts such as walnuts, almonds, pecans and macadamia nuts can be added to provide a characteristic texture to brownies.</p>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>2 eggs with a little water</li>
    <li>Powdered sugar</li>
    <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>Oil</li>
    <li> 1/2 teaspoon of Vanilla Extract</li>
</ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>First, mix together the dry and wet ingredients in two separate bowls. Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large one.</li>
    <li>Next, combine the wet and dry ingredients. Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. The batter will be thick!</li>
    <li>Then, pour the batter into an 8×8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper. Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick – that’s ok.</li>
    <li>Finally, bake! Transfer the pan to a 325-degree oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs attached. Allow the brownies to cool completely before slicing and serving.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
